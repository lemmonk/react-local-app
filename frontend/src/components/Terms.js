            then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision
            found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
            jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
            personal jurisdiction of that court.

            These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the APP or in respect to the
            Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise
            or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such right

            these Terms of Use or use of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be construed
            against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have

        <h3>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
        <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
            (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
            your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
            recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
            DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
            tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we
            will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.

            updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we
            make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a
            notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
            Privacy Policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
