            Commercial Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue

            then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision
            found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
            jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
            personal jurisdiction of that court.

        <h3>CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
        <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
            (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about
            your online browsing activities monitored and collected. No uniform technology standard for
            recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to
            DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be
            tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we

            make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a
            notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
            Privacy Policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
