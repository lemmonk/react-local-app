<h1>Progressive Web App</h1>

<h1>Why a PWA?</h1>
<h3>There are many benifits to choosing to build a PWA instead of a more traditional app, including performance, ease of use, and accessability, but by and large the biggest reason is its ability to provide our customers with a fair and honest pricing model.  PWA's allow developers to circumvent the app stores and their hefty platform fees.

    We invite you to read the following article if you wish to learn more about how we came to our decision, and progressive web apps as a whole.  Thank you for using Locals, your ongoing support is what keeps us going.
